""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will display the solutions to
any number of quadratic equations. Your program will ask the user how many
quadratic equations they would like to solve, ask for the coefficients of the
equation in the standard form of ax2 + bx + c = 0 , solve for x, and then
display the solutions. Your program will allow for both real and complex
solutions.
