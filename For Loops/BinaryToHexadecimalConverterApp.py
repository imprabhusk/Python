""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will generate binary and
hexadecimal values from 1 up to a specified user value. Recall that decimal is
a base 10 number system, binary is a base 2 number system, and hexadecimal is
a base 16 number system. Your program will use list slicing to first only show
a portion of these values. Your program will then loop through the entire
lists of decimal, binary, and hexadecimal values to show the relationship
between numbers of different bases.
