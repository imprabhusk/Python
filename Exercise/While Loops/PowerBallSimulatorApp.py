""" Description

You are responsible for writing a program that simulates the Power Ball
Lottery. The traditional power ball is played by randomly choosing 5 white
balls numbered 1 through 69 then randomly choosing 1 red ball numbered 1
through 26. The traditional power ball has astronomically low odds of
winning. Therefore, your program will allow users to adjust the odds by
setting how many balls the lottery will choose from. Your program will
then calculate the odds the user has of winning. The user will purchase
tickets in a set interval, without purchasing repeated losing tickets,
until they either win the lottery or choose to give up.
