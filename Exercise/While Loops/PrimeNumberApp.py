""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will either determine if a
given number is prime or display all prime numbers within a given range of
values. When determining all prime numbers within a given range, your program
will time the process and report how long the calculations took to the user.
It is important to time certain processes within our programs so we can so how
efficient our code is.
