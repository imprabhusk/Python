""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will analyse the letter
distribution of a given text. Your program will take any text, remove all
non-alpha characters, count the frequency of each letter within the text,
calculate the percentage of occurrence for each letter, and create a list of
letters ordered from highest occurrence to lowest occurrence. Your program
will perform these operations for two different bodies of text.
