""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will conduct a poll on a yes or
no issue. Upon starting the program a user will be prompted for an issue to
vote on, the number of voters, and a password to view the poll results. You
program will then conduct the poll. Each time a user votes, your program will
ask for the voters full name to verify that they have not yet voted. If the
voter has not yet voted, they will be presented with the issue and can vote
yes or no. The vote will be recorded. Once the number of voters specified by
the user has been reached, the poll will close and a summary will be
displayed. If the user enters the correct password a result of each voters
name and how they voted will be displayed.
