""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will highlight the similarities
and differences between four different types of lists: a list of strings, a
list of integers, a list of floats, and a list of lists. For each list, your
program will describe the data type of the list, the elements of the list, and
the data type of the first element in the list. Your program will then
highlight the similarities and differences between sorting a list numerically
and alphabetically.
