""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will simulate a grocery
shopping list. Your program will start with two items on the shopping list,
meat and cheese, and then allow a user to add three new items to the list. To
simulate shopping, your program will ask the user what item they just
purchased and then remove the item from the shopping list. Upon having only
two items in the shopping list, your program will inform the user that the
store is out of a particular item and prompt the user to replace the item with
a new item. You will use the datetime library to display the current date and
time the shopping is taking place in mm/dd hh:mm format.
