""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will create a list of a userâ€™s
favorite teachers. It will display these teachers ranked (assuming the first
teacher entered is the favorite, the second teacher entered is the next
favorite, ect...), alphabetically, in reverse alphabetical order, the top two
teachers, the next two teachers, the last favorite teacher, and the total
number of favorite teachers in the list. Your program will then add and remove
teachers from this list, each time displaying a similar summary.
