""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will create a list of a user’s
favorite teachers. It will display these teachers ranked (assuming the first
teacher entered is the favorite, the second teacher entered is the next
favorite, ect...), alphabetically, in reverse alphabetical order, the top two
