""" Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will play the classic “Hi Low”
game. Your program will randomly pick a number between 1 and 20. Users will
then guess the number. With each guess, your program will respond that the
user’s guess is either too high or too low. When the user guesses correct, or
after 5 guesses, your program will end the game and summarize the results.
